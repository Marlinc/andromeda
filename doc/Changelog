 * mm/map.c:
    This file holds the new memory map, which is responsible for keeping track
    of which pages have been allocated, and which are free.
    In the future we will connect our swapping deamon with this map, to keep
    enough pages free.

 * mm/paging.c:
    We have implemented a new paging subsystem which only allocs a page-table
    when it is required, keeping memory usage to a relative minimum.
    What still needs to be done is keep better track of the location of the page
    directory which is now approached with a fixed offset.

 * kern/sched.c
    Stubs are made for multiple threads. This enables us to keep track of
    segments for individual processes. these segments are implemented as doubly-
    linked lists in the memory map in mm/map.c.
