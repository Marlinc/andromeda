TODO:

ANDROMEDA GENERAL
*	Write comments.
	The reason for this might seem obvious, as
	it is a piece of software for learning
	purposes.

*	Improve the memory allocation code.
	The kernel now just uses an awful lot of memory
	in a region which can't be guarranteed.
	The new system has to dynamically add blocks to
	the list taking into account where the
	compressed, core and module images are.
	In other words it needs to use the memory bitmap.

ABDROMEDA COMPRESSED
*	Make a start on paging code
	needed to load the kernel in high memory.

*	Make image loading code.
	To load the decompressed kernel.

*	Start the decompressed kernel.

ANDROMEDA DECOMPRESSED
*	Use the code from the above platform.
	This needs to be in high memory though.

*	Implement interrupts.
	Needed to load in other processes.

*	Design and implement a scheduler.
	Preferrably priority and sleeptime based.

*	Start work on Usermode

*	Start work on the driver subsystem

*	Start work on an API.
	such as libc (newlibc apparently is a
	relatively easy port).

USERMODE
*	Start work on a virtual file system and
	File system deamon.

DRIVERSUBSYSTEM
*	Start work on the disk drivers

*	Start work on tty's

*	Resume work on the IRQ's
