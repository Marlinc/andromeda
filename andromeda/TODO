TODO:

ANDROMEDA GENERAL
*	Write comments.
	The reason for this might seem obvious, as
	it is a piece of software for learning
	purposes.

*	Improve the memory allocation code.
	The kernel now just uses all of it's memory.
	For the sake of memory protection, I'd like
	to put a cap on that and have it request a
	block of memory each time it runs out.
	The allocator also needs to recognise unused
	blocks and return those to the system.

ABDROMEDA COMPRESSED
*	Make a start on paging code
	needed to load the kernel in high memory.

*	Filesystem implementation.
	Is required to load the decompressed kernel.

*	Make image loading code.
	To load the decompressed kernel.

*	Start the decompressed kernel.

ANDROMEDA DECOMPRESSED
*	Use the code from the above platform.
	This needs to be in high memory though.

*	Implement interrupts.
	Needed to load in other processes.

*	Design and implement a scheduler.
	Preferrably priority and sleeptime based.

*	Start work on an API.
	such as libc (newlibc apparently is a
	relatively easy port).
