What is done:

	* Fixed A20 line on 15th of april..
	* Rewrite of the A20 Line enabling code
	* device reset
	* Reading a sector with int 013H
	* Created a shell script to assembly the first and second stage.
	* Jumping to the second stage bootloader.
	* Shell scripts to build and clean

What should be improved:
	* Sector readers (both 0x13 ah=2h and 0x13 ah=042H)

Next item:
	* rewrite the sector read code
	* Read theory about memory addressing (liniear, absoluut, seg:off) => 

What has to be done:

	* Write the gdt code
	* Switch to pmode
	* 32 bits
	* write kernelmain

Notes:
足eerst image loading met interrupts, dan far jump, 足dan GDT
足opnieuw far jump
足en dan de pm

//-----//
In real mode, you obtain a linear address by adding the segment * 0x10 to the offset, so:

la = (seg * 0x10) + offset

0x1000:0x0002 == 0x10002 linear.
