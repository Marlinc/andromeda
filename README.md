Some info about the bootloader
Error table
0x0 -> Error in the masterboot, probably because you haven't marked a partition as active.
0x1 -> Stage 1 error. Serious failure, checks which succeeded in the masterboot failed in 
	stage 1. Should not occur, actually pure a leftover from early debugging.
0x1.5 -> Look above
0x2 -> The second stage loader couldn't enable a feature such as the A20 line. This might indicate hardware problems if it occurs,
	or your hard ware doesn't support the way they are supported.
