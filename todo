What is done:

	* Fixed A20 line on 15th of april..
	* Rewrite of the A20 Line enabling code
	* device reset
	* Reading a sector with int 013H
	* Created a shell script to assembly the first and second stage.
	* Jumping to the second stage bootloader.
	* Shell scripts to build and clean
	* Rewrite of the image loaders
	* GDT and pm implemented

What should be improved:

Next item:
	* Read theory about memory addressing (liniear, absoluut, seg:off) => 
	* Multiboot compatibility
	* Makefiles
	* Link the kernel into the bootloader.

What has to be done:

	* Make the bootloader multiboot compatible
	* write a make file
	* Get the kernel working.

Notes:
足eerst image loading met interrupts, dan far jump, 足dan GDT
足opnieuw far jump
足en dan de pm

//-----//
In real mode, you obtain a linear address by adding the segment * 0x10 to the offset, so:

la = (seg * 0x10) + offset

0x1000:0x0002 == 0x10002 linear.
