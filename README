This bootloader is in development for educational use. There is no guarantee that it functions properly.

If you are trying to run it with bochs and it 'tripples' with the error that you are trying to read a sector which is out of bounds, you should edit the bochsrc file and set the amout of sectors to the correct value.

Error table
0x0 -> Stage 1 failed to load stage 1.5
0x1 -> Could not open the A20 gate.
0x2 -> Dynamic sector loader in stage 1.5 failed to load stage 2 and the kernel.
