This bootloader is in development for educational use. There is no guarantee that it functions properly.

If you are trying to run it with bochs and it 'tripples' with the error that you are trying to read a sector which is out of bounds, you should edit the bochsrc file and set the amout of sectors to the correct value.

Error table
0x0 -> Error in the masterboot, probably because you haven't marked a partition as active.
0x1 -> Stage 1 error. Serious failure, checks which succeeded in the masterboot failed in 
	stage 1. Should not occur, actually pure a leftover from early debugging.
0x1.5 -> Look above
0x2 -> The second stage loader couldn't enable a feature such as the A20 line. This might indicate hardware problems if it occurs,
	or your hard ware doesn't support the way they are supported.
