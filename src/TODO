TODO:

	After the nearest galaxy to our own.

COMPRESSED
*	Develop paged and unpaged memory management.
	Preferrebly in the same portion of code.
	Needed for the page tables.

*	Make a start on paging code
	needed to load the kernel in high memory.

*	Filesystem implementation.
	Is required to load the decompressed kernel.

*	Make image loading code.
	To load the decompressed kernel.

*	Start the decompressed kernel.

DECOMPRESSED
*	Use the code from the above platform.
	This needs to be in high memory though.

*	Implement interrupts and exceptions.
	Needed to load in other processes.

*	Design and implement a scheduler.
	Preferrably priority and sleeptime based.

*	Start work on an API.
	such as libc (newlibc apparently is a
	relatively easy port).

*	Make a start on the basic userland tools.
	Such as a shell, commands, a compiler,
